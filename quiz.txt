Week 1 Quiz

What is the value of a after the below code is executed?
a = 1
b = a
b = 3

# a = 1

What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?

# array is an ordered list of item with an index. A hash is a container of item identified by a key and a value

Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]

# [1, 2, 3, 3]

[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq

# [1, 2, 3]

[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!

# [1, 2, 3]

What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.

# Map return true or false: Using the array of the previous example

# arr.map {|value| 1 == value } return [true, false, false, false]
# arr.select {|value| 3 == value } return [3, 3]


Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

# h = { "key" => "value" }

What is returned?
x = 1
x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

# "no way!"


What is x?

x = 1
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

What is x?

# x is four. 1 + 3 increment in the cycle

3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

# x is nil, is not definited. You can use + for nil object
